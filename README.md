# Node Farm Website
One of my first pieces to create a dynamic website using NODE.JS, a simple API, HTML, CSS, JS, JSON.

<p>A simple website that displays products to choose from and you can click into them via the details tab to learn more about that product</p>
<br>
<p>The site is built using HTML templates for the products and a template card for each product as well as an overview page. I have used Javascript to bring this all together to create a dynamic website with use of a simple API.<br>
  Using json to create the products (data.json) and pulling them into the site via their unique ID number.<br>
  Also i have created the replaceTmeplate function into a module so that it can then be pulled into future projects if needed.
